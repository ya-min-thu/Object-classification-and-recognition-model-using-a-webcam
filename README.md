# Object classification and recognition model using a webcam

## Project Summary:

This project aims to develop an object classification and recognition model using a webcam. The model will be trained to classify hand gestures corresponding to five different categories: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, and spock. The model architecture involves utilizing a pre-trained MobileNet model for feature extraction, followed by additional layers for classification. The training data will be collected through the webcam, and the model will be trained using TensorFlow.js.

## Technology and Packages Used:

- TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser.
- MobileNet: A pre-trained deep learning model for image classification.
- HTML/CSS: For building the user interface.
- JavaScript: For implementing the logic, handling user interactions, and integrating TensorFlow.js for model training and inference.
